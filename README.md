# My Homepage
This is a Nextjs 13 project which acts as as my homepage as well as hosting a simple blog.

Frontend is React using NextJS13 (with the app directory)

Backend is a Sanity Content Lake hosting the Blog Content

The blog content is statically generated and hosted on Sanity CMS.

A template that was also used in the initial generation of this project can be found
[here](https://github.com/sanity-io/nextjs-blog-cms-sanity-v3)

I also integrated the Spotify API to grab what song I am currently listening to and to display my top artists and for this I will credit [leerob.io](https://leerob.io) and in particular this [blog post](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs)

Feel free to use whatever code you want if you find it useful, just don't copy any of my personal info for nefarious purposes.
